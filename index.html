<p> Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who is widely regarded as one of the greatest scientists in history. He was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire. Einstein's groundbreaking contributions to physics revolutionized our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe.

  His most famous work includes the theory of relativity, which he developed in the early 20th century. The special theory of relativity, published in 1905, introduced the famous equation E=mc², expressing the equivalence of energy (E) and mass (m). In 1915, Einstein presented the general theory of relativity, which described gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.</p>

                  Mother Teresa, also known as Saint Teresa of Calcutta, was a Roman Catholic nun and missionary. She was born as Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu on August 26, 1910, in Skopje (now the capital of North Macedonia). At the age of 18, she left her home in Skopje to join the Sisters of Loreto in Ireland.
                  
                  In 1929, she moved to Calcutta (now Kolkata), India, where she taught at St. Mary's High School. However, in 1946, she experienced what she described as a "call within a call" from God, urging her to work among the poorest of the poor. She received permission from the Vatican to leave the Sisters of Loreto and began her missionary work in the slums of Calcutta.</p>

                <p>Abdus Salam (1926–1996) was a Pakistani theoretical physicist known for his contributions to the field of electroweak unification, a significant development in the understanding of the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces. He was born on January 29, 1926, in Jhang, British India (now in Pakistan).

                  Salam, along with Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg, independently formulated the electroweak theory in the early 1970s. This theory successfully unified electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force into a single framework, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the fundamental forces governing the behavior of subatomic particles.</p>

                  Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani activist for female education and the youngest-ever recipient of the Nobel Prize. She was born on July 12, 1997, in Mingora, Swat Valley, Pakistan. Malala gained international prominence for her advocacy for girls' education and women's rights, particularly in the Swat Valley, where the Taliban had, at times, banned girls from attending school.
                  
                  In 2012, when Malala was 15 years old, she survived an assassination attempt by a Taliban gunman. The attack on her school bus was in retaliation for her activism promoting education for girls.</p>

      <p>Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937) was a New Zealand-born physicist who made significant contributions to the understanding of the structure of the atom. Here are some key aspects of his contributions and his scientific legacy:
      <p>Rutherford conducted the famous gold foil experiment in 1909, in which he bombarded thin gold foil with alpha particles. Based on the unexpected results of the experiment, Rutherford proposed a new model for the structure of the atom. He suggested that the atom has a small, dense nucleus at its center, containing positively charged protons, and that the majority of the atom's volume is empty space with electrons orbiting the nucleus. <br>Rutherford was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1908 for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements and the chemistry of radioactive substances.<br> This recognition highlighted the importance of his work in advancing our understanding of atomic structure.<br>Rutherford held various academic positions, including the Cavendish Professorship of Experimental Physics at the University of Cambridge. Many of his students and collaborators went on to make significant contributions to physics, including Niels Bohr, James Chadwick, and Ernest Marsden.</p>

          <p style="color: rgb(127, 125, 125);font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">In the 1980s, high levels of road traffic near Millau in the Tarn valley were causing congestion, especially in the summer due to holiday traffic on the route from Paris to Spain. A method of bypassing Millau had long been considered, not only to ease the flow and reduce journey times for long-distance traffic, but also to improve the quality of access to Millau for its local businesses and residents. One of the solutions considered was the construction of a road bridge to span the river and gorge valley.[10] The first plans for a bridge were discussed in 1987 by CETE, and by October 1991 the decision was made to build a high crossing of the Tarn by a structure of around 2,500 metres (8,200 ft) in length. During 1993–1994, the government consulted with seven architects and eight structural engineers. During 1995–1996, a second definition study was made by five associated architect groups and structural engineers. In January 1995, the government issued a declaration of public interest to solicit design approaches for a competition.[11]</p> -->

In March 2001, Eiffage established the subsidiary Compagnie Eiffage du Viaduc de Millau (CEVM), and was declared winner of the contest and awarded the prime contract in August.[14][1]

    <p>Jane Addams (1860–1935) was a prominent American social reformer, peace activist, and leader in the field of social work. She is best known for her work in addressing social issues and her efforts to improve the lives of marginalized communities.

      Key aspects of Jane Addams's life and contributions include:

      
    <p>In 1889, Jane Addams co-founded Hull House in Chicago, one of the first settlement houses in the United States. Hull House aimed to provide social and educational services to the impoverished immigrant population in the surrounding neighborhood. It became a model for the settlement house movement, which sought to bridge gaps between different social classes and address the needs of the urban poor. <br>ddams is considered a pioneer in the field of social work. She emphasized the importance of addressing the root causes of social problems and advocated for social reforms to alleviate poverty, improve working conditions, and promote education.<br>Jane Addams's legacy extends beyond her lifetime, and she is remembered as a compassionate and dedicated reformer who worked tirelessly to create a more just and equitable society. Hull House, as a symbol of her commitment to social justice, became a center for community services and social reform activities and inspired the development of similar institutions across the United States. </p>
